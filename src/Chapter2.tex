There is a high interest and a huge amount of work the scientific community
dedicates to understanding the patterns of human mobility. The knowledge we
can gain from the results of this work has the potential to benefit a wide
variety of industries from the modeling and maintenance of the transportation infrastructe,
to the medical industry where we can use this knowledge in trying to prevent the
spreading of epidemies. \ref{Brockmann08} %TODO - add references

Various studies have been conducted in order to gain a better understanding of
the human mobility patters. These studies give us results that seem to support
each other in the idea that people are less spontaneous than they would like to
think themselves and that, indeed, our behaviour shows that we are quite rooted
into habbits when it comes to the way we travel.

Brockmann, Hufnagel and Geisel\ref{Brockmann06} have
analyzed the human movement based on the way bank notes were dispersed through
the United States (excluding Alaska and Hawaii). Their study shows that a
relatively small percentage of bank notes ($23.6\%$) traveled for more than
$800$ km, while a fraction of $19.1\%$ did not traveled for more than $50$ km
even after a year of being observed. The possible explanation the authors have
given for these findins are that, in general, people would be less inclined to
leave the areas of the large cities or the places they usually conduct their
lives.

% TODO - calls and distances
A. L. Barabasi, M. C. Gonzalez and C. A. Hidalgo have conducted a study that
deals with studying the trajectories of over $100000$ mobile phone users with
anonymized identities. The study was conducted in order to see if there are any
patterns in our mobility habbits. Among the things that have been subjected to
testing was the return probability of individuals in the same place as in the
past. The study shows there is, in general, a peak in the return probability
after $24$, $48$ or $72$ since they have left a particular location. This shows
that we humans tend to visit locations periodically. This can be explained by
our going to places such as work, school, grocery shops near our home etc.

The authors have also ranked the locations the mobile phone users frequented
based on the number of times they have been spotted nearby. The results for this
have shown that the probability of finding someone near a location that is
ranked for them with a level $L$ can be estimated with $1/L$. Another
interesting finding that is mentioned in the paper is that, in general, people
seem to be spending the majority of their time in just a few locations, while
diving the remaining time just between a limited number of locations that varies
for the subjects from as low as $5$ to around $50$.

There are some note worthy plots that the authors present in the paper. They can
be seen in figure{} and they show that most people travel over short distances,
yet there is a small number of people that regularly travel over big distances.
%This is something that might raise the interesting question of whether those
%people who travel over longer distances, are less predictable than those who do
%not. - something to referenciate when writting about the other paper with
% limits of predictability

The results of this study are a major indicator that individuals display a high
level of regularity and that we have a tendency to spend most of our times in
places that are familiar to us, or that require us to visit them regularly
(e.g. home, work).
