Human mobility has been attracting a high degree of attention from numerous
study fields among which we find urban and traffic planning, traffic prediction,
the spreading of diseases and many others \cite{AsgariGB13} \cite{Brockmann08}.

The studies that have been conducted on this subject have been using various
ways to identify the travel behaviour of people. Some of them have focused on
studying the information gathered from observing the way in which money is
dispersed through time \cite{Brockmann06}, or they have been focusing in
studying the behaviour of mobile phone users by analyzing the way they move
based on the communication towers their phones are connecting to when they are
engaging in voice communication \cite{Barabasi08}. There are studies that try to
understand human mobility through the glass of social networks
\cite{yang2010using}, as it can be observed that individuals prefer to meet with
other people that are part of their community more often
\cite{Musolesi:2007:DMM:1317425.1317433}. GPS data has also been considered for
various studies \cite{cuttone2014inferring}, \cite{5657695}. The list of
elements that have been taken into consideration for trying to understand and
predict the way in which we are conducting our daily travels is far from being
short. 

\section{Location identification based on Wifi data}
 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Intro - done
  \item previous studies on what does a location is considering wifi
  fingerprints
  \item analazying what can determine a location fingerprint
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Plot access pointsâ€™ presence over time considering their signal strength
		\item Plot number of samples of each access point over time
		\item Plot the average signal strength for various time windows for each
		access point identified for a user
		\item Plot the running average signal strength for 2,5 and 10 min time windows
		for each access point identified for a user
		\item Plot of access point presence in time bin (5 mins used for time bin)
		without considering its signal strength
	\end{itemize}
  \item identifying locations
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Networks 
		\item Hidden Markov Models 
		\item Further improvements (data cleaning)
	\end{itemize}
  \item matching locations locations
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Percentage similarity 
		\item Keeping track of previous locations 
		\item Creating fingerprints
	\end{itemize}
  \item
