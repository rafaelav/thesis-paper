\section{Variations for signal strength visualization over time}
\label{appendix_signal_strength}

This section contains various visualizations for different users' scanned access
points over time. On the x axis we have the time frame, while on the y axis we
have the signal strength for the identified access points. The legend presents
only the top $10$ predominant access points (which have appeared the most
during scans), however the plot displays all access points. The figures are
Fig.~\ref{user_6_cross_1d}, Fig.\ref{user_6_star_1d},
Fig.~\ref{user_6_cross_line_1d}, Fig.\ref{user_6_o_line_1d}.

\section{Sample density for APs identified for a user}
\label{appendix_sample_density}

This section contains the visualization for the signal strength of the APs
identified as being associated to a user throughout $3$ days as well as the
sample density for the top $10$ predominant APs throughout this time.

\subsection{Average signal strength for APs identified for a user}
\label{appendix_avg_signal}

This section contains the visualization for the signal strength of the APs
identified as being associated to a user throughout $3$ days as well as the
average signal for the top $10$ predominant APs calculated for a consecutive $5$
minutes time windows throughout the $3$ days.
