\chapter{Summary - English}

The understanding of human mobility patterns constitutes a focus point in the
science world today and has been the main topic of numerous studies. The data
that has been used in order to analyze the mobility patterns varies from GPS
data, to data collected by telecommunication towers and even to information
extracted from the dispersion of bank notes. In this paper we study the
inferring of mobility patterns from Wifi data. We analyze methods that can be
used for identifying stop locations with the help of Wifi data, we compare our
results with stop locations identified using GPS data and we explore the degree
of predictability of human travel trajectories.
