The understanding of human mobility patterns constitutes a focus point in the
science world today. There are numerous studies that have been conducted in
order to explore the present subject. The data that has been used in order to
analyze the mobility patterns varies from GPS data, to data collected by mobile
phone towers and even the information extracted from the dispersion of bank
notes. In this paper we study the inferring of mobility patterns from Wifi data.
We analyze methods that can be used for identifying stop locations with the help
of Wifi data, we compare our results with stop locations identified by using GPS
data and we explore the degree of predictability which defines the decisions
based on which our travel trajectories are formed.
